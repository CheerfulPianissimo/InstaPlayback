# What is this?
This is a simple android app that bridges audio from your microphone input to your speaker output.

# Why?
It's intented for use with other system audio routing apps like [sndcpy](https://github.com/rom1v/sndcpy). One method of usage is:

` Microphone -> InstaPlayback -> sndcpy -> [Network] -> [Receiving Device]-> Remote Speaker `

This basically allows your android device to be used as a remote microphone over a network. 

# How?
To run it, clone and open the repo in Android Studio. There are no dependencies so the build should be straightforward.
